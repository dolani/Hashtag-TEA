<center> <h3>A PWA for Tea Lovers using Tea API (TAPI)</h3> </center>


## About #TEA
It is a very simple PWA that showcases the Tea API as an app for use. [See Demo](https://victoria-lo.github.io/Hashtag-TEA/).
> Note: Tea API is deployed on heroku (free tier), might need to wait a little for the PWA to fetch data

Users can browse teas from the API, post comments to a single tea and share the PWA on Twitter!
